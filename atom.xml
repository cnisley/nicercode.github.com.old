    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to everyone who came along and was such good sports with
learning git today.  The notes are available (in fairly raw form)
<a href="http://nicercode.github.com/git">here</a>.  Please let us know where they are unclear and we will
update them.</p>

<p>Hopefully you now have enough tools to help you use git in your own
projects.  To re-emphasise our closing message – start using it on a
project, start thinking about what you want to track, and start
thinking about what constitutes a logical commit.  Once you get into a
rhythm it will seem much easier.  Bring your questions along to the
class in 2 weeks time.</p>

<p>Also, to re-emphasise that git is not a backup system.  Make sure that
you have your work backed up, just in case something terrible happens.
I recommend <a href="http://www.crashplan.com/">crash plan</a> which you can use
for free for backing up onto external hard drives (and for a fee).</p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

<p>We welcome any and all feedback on the material and how we present it.
You can give <em>anonymous</em> feedback by emailing G2G admin (you should
have the address already – I’m only not putting it up here in a vain
effort to slow down spam bots).  Alternatively, you are welcome to

<p>Writing code is fast becoming a key - if not the most important - skill for 
doing research in the 21st century. As scientists, we live in extraordinary 
times. The amount of data (information) available to us is increasingly 
exponentially, allowing for rapid advances in our understanding of the world 
around us. The amount of information contained in a standard scientific paper 
also seems to be on the rise. Researchers therefore need to be able to handle 
ever larger amounts of data to ask novel questions and get papers published.
Yet, the standard tools used by many biologists -  point and click programs for 
manipulating data, doing stats and making plots - do not allow us to scale-up 
our analyses to match data availability, at least not without many, many more 
‘clicks’. </p>

<p>The solution is to write scripts in programs like 
<a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> or 
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com.au/products/matlab/">matlab</a>. Scripting allows you to 
automate analyses, and therefore scale-up without a big increase in 
effort.  </p>

<p>Writing code also offers other benefits to research. When your 
analyses are documented in a script, it is easier to pick up a project and 
start working on it again. You have a record of what you did and why. Chunks 
of code can also be reused in new projects, saving vast amount of time. Writing 
code also allows for effective collaboration with people from all over the 
world. For all these reasons, many researchers are now learning how to write 
code.</p>

<p>Yet, most researchers have no or limited formal training in computer science, 
and thus struggle to write nice code. Most of us are self-taught, having used a 
mix of books, advice from other amateur coders, internet posts, and lots of 
trial and error. Soon after have we written our first R script, our hard drives 
explode with large bodies of barely readable code that we only half understand, 
that also happens to be full of bugs and is generally difficult to use. Not 
surprisingly, many researchers find writing code to be a relatively painful 
process, involving lots of trial and error and, inevitably, frustration. </p>

<p>If this sounds familiar to you, don’t worry, you are not alone. There are many 
<a href="http://nicercode.github.com/intro/resources.html">great R resources</a> available, but most show you how 
to do some fancy trick, e.g. run some complicated statistical test or make a 
fancy plot. Few people - outside of computer science departments - spend time 
discussing the qualities of nice code and teaching you good coding habits. 
Certainly no one is teaching you these skills in your standard biology research 
department.</p>

<p>Observing how colleagues were struggling with their code, we 
(<a href="http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~fitzjohn/">Rich FitzJohn</a> and 
<a href="http://www.falsters.net/daniel">Daniel Falster</a>) have teamed up to bring you 
the <a href="http://nicercode.github.io/">nice R code</a> course and blog. We are 
targeting researchers who are already using R and want to take their coding to 
the next level. Our goal is to help you write nicer code. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By ‘nicer’ we mean 
code that is easy to read, easy to write, runs fast, gives reliable results, is 
easy to reuse in new projects, and is easy to share with collaborators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We 
will be focussing on elements of workflow, good coding habits and some tricks,
that will help transform your code from messy to nice.</p>

<p>The inspiration for nice R code came in part from attending a boot camp run by 
Greg Wilson from the <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">software carpentry team</a>. 
These boot camps aim to help researchers be more productive by teaching them 
basic computing skills. Unlike other software courses we had attended, the 
focus in the boot camps was on good programming habits and design. As 
biologists, we saw a need for more material focussed on R, the language that 
has come to dominate biological research. We are not experts, but have more 
experience than many biologists. Hence the nice R code blog.</p>

<h2 id="key-elements-of-nice-r-code">Key elements of nice R code</h2>
<p>We will now briefly consider some of the key principles of writing nice code. </p>

<h3 id="nice-code-is-easy-to-read">Nice code is easy to read</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for 
machines to execute.
– from “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs” by Abelson and 
Sussman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Readability is by far the most important guiding principle for writing nicer 
code. <strong>Anyone (especially you) should be able to pick up any of your 
projects, understand what the code does and how to run it</strong>. Most code 
written for research purposes is not easy to read.</p>

<p>In our opinion, there are no fixed rules for what nice code should look like. 
There 
is just a single test: is it easy to read? To check how nice your code
is, pass it to a collaborator, or pick up some code you haven’t used for 
over a year. Do they (you) understand it?</p>

<p>Below are some general guidelines for making your code more readable. We 
will explore each of these in more detail here on the blog:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a sensible directory structure for organising project related 
materials. </li>
  <li>Abstract your code into many small functions with helpful descriptive 
names </li>
  <li>Use comments, design features, and meaningful variable or function names 
to capture the intent of your code, i.e. describe what it is <em>meant</em> to do</li>
  <li>Use version control. Of the many reasons for using version control, one is 
that it archives older versions of your code, permitting you to ruthlessly 
yet safely delete old files. This helps reduce clutter and improves readability. </li>
  <li>Apply a consistent style, such as that described in  the <a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google-r-style.html">google R style 
guide</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nice-code-is-reliable-ie-bug-free">Nice code is reliable, i.e. bug free</h3>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Occma&#8217;s raz0r: if your program isn&#8217;t working, it&#8217;s probably just a typo in the code, not an undiscovered bug or thing you&#8217;re doing wrong</p>&mdash; Alison Abreu-Garcia (@alisonag) <a href="https://twitter.com/alisonag/status/322374461212995584">April 11, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="http://nicercode.github.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The computer does exactly what you tell it to. If there is a problem in your code, it’s most likely you put it there. How certain 
are you that your code is error free? More than once I have reached a state 
of near panic, looking over my code to ensure it is bug free before 
submitting a final version of a paper for publication. What if I got it wrong?</p>

<p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2005.54">It is almost impossible to ensure code is bug free</a>, but one can adopt healthy
habits that minimise the chance of this occurring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t repeat yourself. The less you type, the fewer chances there are for 
mistakes</li>
  <li>Use test scripts, to compare your code against known cases</li>
  <li>Avoid using global variables, the attach function and <a href="../intro/bad-habits.html">other nasties</a>
where ownership of data cannot be ensured</li>
  <li>Use version control so that you see what has changed, and easily trace 
mistakes</li>
  <li>Wherever possible, open your code and project up for review, either by 
colleagues, during review process, or in repositories such as github.</li>
  <li>The more <em>readable</em> your code is, the less likely it is to contain 
errors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nice-code-runs-quickly-and-is-therefore-a-pleasure-to-use">Nice code runs quickly and is therefore a pleasure to use</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The faster you can make the plot, the more fun you will have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Code that is slow to run is less fun to use. By <em>slow</em> I mean anything
that takes more than a few seconds to run, so impedes analysis. 
Speed is particularly an issue for people analysing large datasets, or 
running complex simulations, where code may run for many hours, days, 
or weeks. </p>

<p>Some effective strategies for making code run faster:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Abstract your code into functions, so that you can compare different 
versions</li>
  <li>Use code profiling to identify the main computational bottlenecks
and improve them</li>
  <li>Think carefully about algorithm design</li>
  <li>Understand why some operations are intrinsically slower 
than others, e.g. why a <code>for</code> loop is slower than using <code>lapply</code></li>
  <li>Use multiple processors to increase computing power, either in your
own machine or by running your code on a cluster.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-writing-nicer-code">The benefits of writing nicer code</h2>
<p>There are many benefits of writing nicer code:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Better science</strong>: nice code allows you to handle bigger data sets and has less bugs.</li>
  <li><strong>More fun</strong>: spend less time wrestling with R, and more time working with data.</li>
  <li><strong>Become more efficient</strong>: Nice code is reusable, sharable, and quicker to run. </li>
  <li><strong>Future employment</strong>: You should consider anything you write (open or closed) to be a potential advert to a future employer. Code has impact. Code sharing <a href="http://resume.github.io/?cboettig">sites like github now make resumes for you</a>, to capture your impact.  Scientists with an analytical bent are often <a href="http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7440-271">sought-after in the natural sciences</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need further motivation, consider this advice</p>

<p><span class="caption-wrapper centre"><img class="caption" src="http://nicercode.github.com/images/Maniac.jpg" width="" height="" alt="An [advisory pop-up for MS Visual C++](http://www.winsoft.se/2009/08/the-maintainer-might-be-a-maniac-serial-killer)" title="An [advisory pop-up for MS Visual C++](http://www.winsoft.se/2009/08/the-maintainer-might-be-a-maniac-serial-killer)" /><span class="caption-text">An <a href="http://www.winsoft.se/2009/08/the-maintainer-might-be-a-maniac-serial-killer">advisory pop-up for MS Visual C++</a></span></span></p>

<p>This might seem extreme, until you realise that the maniac serial killer is 
<strong>you</strong>, and you definitely know where you live. </p>

<p>At some point, you will 
return to nearly every piece of code you wrote and need to understand it 
afresh. If it is messy code, you will spend a lot of time going over it to 
understand what you did, possibly a week, month, year or decade ago. Although 
you are unlikely get so frustrated as to seek bloody revenge on your former 
self, you might come close. As Greg Wilson stated clearly in our software 
carpentry course, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The single biggest reason you should write nice code is so that your future 
 self can understand it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a by product, code that is easy to read is also easy to 
reuse in new projects and share with colleagues, including as online 
supplementary material. Increasingly, journals are requiring code be submitted 
as part of the review process and these are often published online. Alas, much of the 
current crop of code is difficult to read. At best, having messy code may reduce 
the impact of your paper. But you might also get rejected because the 
reviewer couldn’t understand your code. At worst, some people have had to <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5807/1856.summary">retract high profile work because of bugs in their code</a>.</p>

<p>It’s time to write some nice R code.</p>

<h1 id="directory-layout">Directory layout</h1>

<p>A good project layout helps ensure the</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integrity of data</li>
  <li>Portability of the project</li>
  <li>Easier to pick the project back up after a break</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no one way to lay a project out.  Daniel and I both have
different approaches for different projects, reflecting the history of
the project, who else is collaborating on that project.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of different ideas for laying a project out.  This
is the basic structure that I tend to use:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">proj/
</span><span class="line">├── R/
</span><span class="line">├── data/
</span><span class="line">├── doc/
</span><span class="line">├── figs/
</span><span class="line">└── output/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>R</code> directory contains various files with function definitions
(but <em>only</em> function definitions - no code that actually runs).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>data</code> directory contains data used in the analysis.  This is
treated as <em>read only</em>; in paricular the R files are never allowed
to write to the files in here.  Depending on the project, these
might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have
subdirectories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>doc</code> directory contains the paper.  I work in LaTeX which is
nice because it can pick up figures directly made by R.  Markdown
can do the same and is starting to get traction among biologists.
With Word you’ll have to paste them in yourself as the figures
update.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>figs</code> directory contains the figures.  This directory <em>only
contains generated files</em>; that is, I should always be able to
delete the contents and regenerate them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>output</code> directory contains simuation output, processed
datasets, logs, or other processed things.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this set up, I usually have the R script files that <em>do</em> things in
the project root:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">proj/
</span><span class="line">├── R/
</span><span class="line">├── data/
</span><span class="line">├── doc/
</span><span class="line">├── figs/
</span><span class="line">├── output/
</span><span class="line">└── analysis.R</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>For very simple projects, you might drop the R directory, perhaps
replacing it with a single file <code>analysis-functions.R</code> which you
source.</p>

<p>The top of the analysis file usually looks something like</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="r"><span class="line">library<span class="p">(</span>some_package<span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">library<span class="p">(</span>some_other_package<span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">source<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;R/functions.R&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class="line">source<span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;R/utilities.R&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>…followed by the code that loads the data, cleans it up, runs the
analysis and generates the figures.</p>

<p>Other people have other ideas</p>

would be a nice approach for large projects.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="treat-data-as-read-only">Treat data as read only</h2>

<p>In my mind, this is probably the most important goal of setting up a
project.  Data are typically time consuming and/or expensive to
collect.  Working with them interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they
can be modified means you are never sure of where the data came from,
or how they have been modified.  My suggestion is to put your data
into the <code>data</code> directory and treat it as <em>read only</em>.  Within your
scripts you might generate derived data sets either temporarily (in an
R session only) or semi-permanantly (as an file in <code>output/</code>), but the
original data is always left in an untouched state.</p>

<h2 id="treat-generated-output-as-disposable">Treat generated output as disposable</h2>

<p>In this approach, files in directories <code>figs/</code> and <code>output/</code> are all
generated by the scripts.  A nice thing about this approach is that if
the filenames of generated files change (e.g, changing from
<code>phylogeny.pdf</code> to <code>mammal-phylogeny.pdf</code>) files with the old names
may still stick around, but because they’re in this directory you know
you can always delete them.  Before submitting a paper, I will go
through and delete all the generated files and rerun the analysis to
make sure that I can create all the analyses and figures from the
data.</p>

<h2 id="separate-function-definition-and-application">Separate function definition and application</h2>

<p>When your project is new and shiny, the script file usually contains
many lines of directly executated code.  As it matures, reusable
chunks get pulled into their own functions.  The actual analysis
scripts then become relatively short, and use the functions defined in
scripts in <code>R</code>.  Those scripts do nothing but define functions so that
they can always be <code>source()</code>‘d by the analysis scripts.</p>

<h1 id="setting-up-a-project-in-rstudio">Setting up a project in RStudio</h1>

<p>This gets rid of the #1 problem with most people’s projects face;
where do you find the data.  Two solutions people generally come up
with are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Hard code the full filename for each file you load (e.g.,
<code>/Users/rich/Documents/Projects/Thesis/chapter2/data/mydata.csv</code>)</li>
  <li>Set the working directory at the beginning of your script file
<code>/Users/rich/Documents/Projects/Thesis/chapter2</code> then doing
<code>read.csv("data/mydata.csv")</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The second of these is probably preferable to the first, because the
“special case” part is restricted to just one line in your file.
However, the project is still now quite fragile, because moving it
from one place to another, you must change this file.  Some examples
of when you might do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Archiving a project (moving it from a “current projects” directory
to a new projects directory)</li>
  <li>Giving the code to somebody else (your labmate, collaborator, supervisor)</li>
  <li>Uploading the code with your manuscript submission for review, or to
<a href="http://datadryad.org/">Dryad</a> after acceptance.</li>
  <li>New computer and new directory layout (especially changing
platforms, or if your previous mess got too bad and you wanted to
clean up).</li>
  <li>Any number of new reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>The second case hints at a solution too; if we can start R in a
particular directory then we can just use paths <em>relative to the
project root</em> and have everything work nicely.</p>

<p>To create a project in R studio:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Project”: “Create Project…”</li>
  <li>choose “New Project, (start a project in a new directory)”.</li>
  <li>Leave the “Type” as the default.</li>
  <li>In the “Directory name” type the name for the project.  This might
be <code>chapter2</code> for a thesis, or something more descriptive like
<code>fish_behaviour</code>.</li>
  <li>In the “Create project as a subdirectory of” field select (type or
browse) for the parent directory of the project.  By default this
is probably your home directory, but you might prefer your
Documents folder (I have mine in <code>~/Documents/Projects</code>).</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Nice R code module. This module is targeted at researchers who 
are already using R and want to write nicer code. By ‘nicer’ we mean code that 
is easy to write, is easy to read, runs fast, gives reliable results, is easy 
to reuse in new projects, and is easy to share with collaborators. When you 
write nice code, you do better science, are more productive, and have more fun.</p>

<p>We have a tentative schedule of plans for the 2013 Nice R Code module. The 
module consists of 9 one hour sessions and one 3 hour session. 
The topics covered fall into two broad categories: <em>workflow</em> and
<em>coding</em>. Both are essential for writing nicer code.  At the beginning of the 
module we are going to focus on the
first, as this will cross over into all computing work people do.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The first five sessions will be </p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduction &amp; project set up (9 April)</li>
  <li>Version control with git (23 April) – this will be a longer
session, run with participants from the February software carpentry
bootcamp.</li>
  <li>Coding style (7 May)</li>
  <li>Abstraction and design (21 May)</li>
  <li>Testing code (4 June)</li>
</ol>

<p>Except for the version control session, we will meet from 2-3pm in E8C
212.</p>

<p>These sessions follow very much the same ideas as
<a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org">software carpentry</a>.  Where we
differ is that we will be focusing on <a href="http://r-project.org">R</a>, and
with less emphasis on command line tools and python.</p>

<p>The next sessions (18 June, 2 July, 16 July &amp; 30 July) will either
work on specific R skills or continue through issues arising from the
first five sessions, depending on demand.  Possible specific sessions
include</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data matching, models and avoiding duplication</li>
  <li>Higher order functions and functional programming</li>
  <li>The split/apply/combine pattern</li>
  <li>Creating better graphs (many possible sessions here)</li>
  <li>Code reuse and packaging</li>
  <li>Code profiling and optimisation</li>
  <li>Using and creating simple databases</li>
  <li>Text processing</li>
  <li>Numerical optimisation and algorithms</li>
  <li>Simulation models (an intro only!)</li>
  <li>Packages</li>
</ul>

<p>Along with the skills, we will be doing code review.  The idea will be
for a participant to meet with us immediately after one session and
discuss their problems with us.  They then work on their problem over
the next fortnight and in the next session we will discuss what the
issues were, the possibilities for overcoming them, and the eventual
solutions.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On this blog, we (Daniel Falster and I) are hoping to record bits of
information about using R for ecology and evolution.  Communicating
tips person-to-person is too inefficient, and recently helping out at
a <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">software carpentry</a> boot camp made
us interested in broadcasting ideas more widely.</p>
