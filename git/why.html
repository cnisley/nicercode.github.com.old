  <p>There are many reasons to use version control, and some of these may only
become apparent after you have incorporated it into your workflow (it’s a bit
like “why use R” or “why document your code”).  However, we can immediately 
identify a set of advantages that are very common.</p>

<p>Most of these come from having <strong>a fossil record that captures the evolution of 
your project</strong> (including 
code, data, documentation, analyses, figures, talks, etc).  </p>

<p><img class="centre" src="img/evolution_computer.jpg" /></p>

<p>This fossil record, or project history, is
a series of revisions that connect to each other between the present
and the start of the project.  At any time you can go back to previous
versions, see what you did, and run the code as though you have stepped back in 
time.  </p>

<p><img class="right" src="img/Back-to-the-Future.jpg" /></p>

<p>Having a good fossil history has numerous possible uses :</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You noticed that your code is doing odd things now and didn’t used
to.</strong> Look at and run a version from the last known good code and try
to work out what changed (after this, you should write a unit test –
we’ll cover this in a couple of weeks).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You deleted some code and want to get it back.</strong>  This has a less
obvious, but much more common (and perhaps more important) advantage;
you will be more likely to delete old code rather than commenting it
out, leaving you with shorter, more readable scripts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You want to show your supervisor what you did last week.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inversely, on a collaborative project, <strong>see what your collaborators
wrote last week.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You reformatted everything from numbered citation styles to
author-year after being rejected from journal A and sending your paper
to journal B.  Journal B didn’t want the paper anyway, so you can <strong>get
the previous version back.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You want to experiment</strong> and try something that might break huge
pieces of your project, and know that you can back out if things go
awry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, <strong>you want to try a couple of different strategies for
solving a problem</strong> and review which one you like best (or show them to
someone else).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gives you <strong>an audit-able project history</strong>; you know when you did what
you did.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The other great reason for using version control is that it allows for effective
and transparent collaboration among small or large groups of scientists.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-already-using-version-control">You are already using version control</h2>

<p>Whether you recognise it or not, you are most likely already using some form of 
version control to achieve some of the advantages outlined above. This might 
include</p>

<ul>
  <li>Commented out bits of code / text</li>
  <li>Files with numbers afterwards (<code>thesis_v1.doc</code>, <code>thesis_v2.doc</code>,
<code>thesis_final.doc</code>, <code>thesis_final2.doc</code>, etc) (like in this hilarious 
<a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531">Phd Comic</a>)</li>
  <li>Every so often you zip up the whole project directory and save it with
the date appended to the filename.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most ecologists we know have adopted at least one of these techniques
for doing version control.</p>

<p>In addition, you’ll often see people suggesting putting headers like
this in your code file:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">  ## My file (c) Rich FitzJohn
</span><span class="line">  ## Created: 2012/10/04
</span><span class="line">  ## Modified: 2013/04/04</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Sometimes you’ll even see changelogs embedded in these.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that it’s repetitive and boring, it’s
difficult to extract the information easily (e.g., get me all the
files <strong>I</strong> modified in the last month), there is no checking on the
contents of the fields (dates in the future, forgetting to update
dates, inconsistent names, email addresses).  The <em>point</em> of these
headers is nice — keep track of who did what and when, but this is
far easier to achieve under a good version control system.</p>

<p>Another thing you’ll find in many people’s code is large chunks of old 
code, commented-out because you think you might need it it again one day.</p>

<h2 id="version-control-is-not-a-back-up">Version control is not a back up</h2>

<!--
It appears that this is like a brilliant backup system, but you need a
backup too.  Backing up is a complementary set of functions that
overlap only in that there is usually some history going back.

* Back up but not git: corruption of repository, generated files that
  are not part of a repository but time consuming, installed software
  and other system issues.  It is possible (but often hard) to break
  your git repository; you might reclone from somewhere or you might
  grab the last copy of a backup.  Backup systems usually have larger
  capacity than online version control systems.

* Git but not backup: semantics around files, parallel branched
  versions of files, check out by either checkpoint or time (not just
  last time, etc).-->

<p>A good version control system does not substitute for a good backup 
system. <em>Backing up</em> offers a complementary set of functions that
only partially overlap with those offered by version control. 
In general, you need both.  </p>

<p>I have all my projects under version
control, and my whole documents directory under backup.  If my
computer fails, I immediately copy my documents directory from the
backup to a new computer.  I only need to get the last version though.
On the other hand, at any time I can easily look back through the
history of any project and see the work.  For some projects, the last
modification was months ago, while most backup system will be
seriously thinning by this point (moving to monthly snapshots at best,
and you probably have to pay for that).</p>

<p>Other systems, like Dropbox, are more like backups, as they do not 
store your project history.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-really-need-something-so-complicated">Do I really need something so complicated?</h2>

<p>It’s true that git has a reputation for being hard to learn:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>They say git gets easier once you get the 
basic idea that branches are homeomorphic endofunctors mapping submanifolds of 
a Hilbert space.</p>&mdash; Kornel (@pornelski) <a href="https://twitter.com/pornelski/status/316190292443267073">March 25, 
2013</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>It involves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New concepts</li>
  <li>Some geeky tools</li>
  <li>A bit of hard work. </li>
</ul>

<p>But believe us, it is worth it. One of the things that will make learning git 
challenging for many
ecologists is that most resources (e.g., the excellent
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/">git book</a>) assume that you are coming from a
background of using CVS, SVN or some other centralised version control
system with a nasty abbrevo.  Therefore, they expect you to already be 
thinking in one way
and then show you how to translate those ideas into git’s ideas.</p>

<p>In a way you’re lucky, as you don’t have to learn a bunch of stuff and
then unlearn it (e.g., see
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/embdf/git_complicated_of_cou
rse_not_commits_map_to/c196s4w">here</a>).
Some of the things that git does just make sense with cheaper (and
more decentralised) bandwidth, disk space, and computing power than
the systems that were developed in the past.</p>

<p>If the last two paragraphs meant very little too you, that’s good. It means we 
have a nice clean 
blank slate on which to work. </p>

<p>Let’s begin.</p>
